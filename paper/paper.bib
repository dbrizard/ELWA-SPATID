	abstract = {Central longitudinal impact of slender bodies has a number of important technical applications. Theoretical treatment of these cases has, however, often been unduly scarce or crude, probably because available methods suitable for engineering applications have not been sufficiently well known. This is the first one of a series of papers intended to fill this gap by presenting theoretical solutions for a number of cases of various types, including hammers and bars of various fundamental forms, impact with elastic and plastic deformation and restraint by solid friction, and by suggesting some applications. This paper reviews known analytical, graphical and numerical methods for one-dimensional treatment of longitudinal impact and introduces a slightly modified version of the “graphodynamical” method which will be used in the following. Stress pulse measurements made with wire strain gauges on a bar impacted by cylindrical hammers of various diameters and materials are presented and found to agree reasonably well with corresponding theoretical pulse forms. Formulae and diagrams are given for the influence of the ratio of areas and material constants of hammer and bar on force, stress, energy transmission and other important quantities of the type of impact mentioned.},

	abstract = {A number of impact problems of engineering interest are analyzed by means of a graphical method previously developed by the author. Problems considered comprise: impact at constant velocity of finite duration applied to one end of a bar, the length of the bar being infinite; bars of finite length, the other end being free, and the other end being fixed or restrained; impact stresses below yield stress (elastic range), and impact stresses above yield stress (plastic range). The history and gradient of stress and of velocity are represented in three-dimensional diagrams. The energy expended in impact, and its distribution into energy of plastic deformation, and into residual kinetic and elastic stress energy are determined. The total residual permanent strain is determined. The general treatment is supplemented with numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Simple expressions, based on one-dimensional elastic wave theory, are established which permit prediction of normal force and particle velocity at cross-sections of a non-uniform linearly-elastic rod. The initial normal force and particle velocity at each cross-section of that rod must be known. In order to assess the validity of the assumptions, an experimental test on a cone-shaped rod is performed. Numerical results are provided for two different configurations: a rod shaped at one end in order to perform the Hopkinson three-point bend test and a rod heated at one end for a high temperature dynamic test. The given expressions are so easy to program that a common spreadsheet program is sufficient to implement and perform the calculation. They enable the influence of an impedance variation to be quantified a priori. In the case of the Hopkinson three-point bend test, the wave distortion is not very important if the rise time is long and the length of the shaped end is short. For a heated rod, the conventional Hopkinson treatment is not available when the temperature is too high. Some effects of an idealized quasi-static specimen for both Hopkinson three-point bend and non-uniform temperature are included.},
