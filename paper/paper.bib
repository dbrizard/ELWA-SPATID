	abstract = {This paper presents GUIGUW v0.1, a graphical user interface (GUI) for the computation of stress-guided wave dispersive features. The software exploits semianalytical finite-element (SAFE) formulations for the calculation of wave-propagation characteristics. The interface allows for the selection of geometrical, mechanical, and frequency-related parameters for the computation. Isotropic and anisotropic materials with linear elastic and linear viscoelastic rheological behaviors can be considered, and any waveguide cross section can be modeled. For each existing wave, the dispersive results can be represented in terms of wave number, wavelength, phase velocity, group velocity (for undamped waveguides), energy velocity, and attenuation (for damped waveguides). By simply working with the GUI, original results for guided stress waves can be obtained.},

	abstract = {Simple expressions, based on one-dimensional elastic wave theory, are established which permit prediction of normal force and particle velocity at cross-sections of a non-uniform linearly-elastic rod. The initial normal force and particle velocity at each cross-section of that rod must be known. In order to assess the validity of the assumptions, an experimental test on a cone-shaped rod is performed. Numerical results are provided for two different configurations: a rod shaped at one end in order to perform the Hopkinson three-point bend test and a rod heated at one end for a high temperature dynamic test. The given expressions are so easy to program that a common spreadsheet program is sufficient to implement and perform the calculation. They enable the influence of an impedance variation to be quantified a priori. In the case of the Hopkinson three-point bend test, the wave distortion is not very important if the rise time is long and the length of the shaped end is short. For a heated rod, the conventional Hopkinson treatment is not available when the temperature is too high. Some effects of an idealized quasi-static specimen for both Hopkinson three-point bend and non-uniform temperature are included.},

The history and gradient of stress and of velocity are represented in three-dimensional diagrams. The energy expended in impact, and its distribution into energy of plastic deformation, and into residual kinetic and elastic stress energy are determined. The total residual permanent strain is determined. The general treatment is supplemented with numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Central longitudinal impact of slender bodies has a number of important technical applications. Theoretical treatment of these cases has, however, often been unduly scarce or crude, probably because available methods suitable for engineering applications have not been sufficiently well known. This is the first one of a series of papers intended to fill this gap by presenting theoretical solutions for a number of cases of various types, including hammers and bars of various fundamental forms, impact with elastic and plastic deformation and restraint by solid friction, and by suggesting some applications. This paper reviews known analytical, graphical and numerical methods for one-dimensional treatment of longitudinal impact and introduces a slightly modified version of the “graphodynamical” method which will be used in the following. Stress pulse measurements made with wire strain gauges on a bar impacted by cylindrical hammers of various diameters and materials are presented and found to agree reasonably well with corresponding theoretical pulse forms. Formulae and diagrams are given for the influence of the ratio of areas and material constants of hammer and bar on force, stress, energy transmission and other important quantities of the type of impact mentioned.},

	abstract = {Efficient and accurate predictions of wave propagation are a vital component of wave-based non-destructive interrogation techniques. Although a variety of models are available in the literature, most of them are suited to a particular wave type or a specific frequency regime. In this paper we present a multi-wave model for wave propagation in axisymmetric fluid-filled waveguides, either buried or submerged in a fluid, based on the semi-analytical finite elements. The cross-section is discretised with high-order spectral elements to achieve high efficiency, and the singularities resulting from adopting a Lobatto scheme at the axis of symmetry are handled appropriately. The surrounding medium is modelled with a perfectly matched layer, and a practical rule of choice of its parameters, based only on the material properties and the geometry of the waveguide, is derived. To represent the fluid and the solid-fluid coupling, an acoustic SAFE element and appropriate coupling relationships are formulated. The model is validated against both numerical results from the literature and experiments, and the comparisons show very good agreement. Finally, an implementation of the method in Python is made available with this publication.},
