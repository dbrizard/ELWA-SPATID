	abstract = {A number of impact problems of engineering interest are analyzed by means of a graphical method previously developed by the author. Problems considered comprise: impact at constant velocity of finite duration applied to one end of a bar, the length of the bar being infinite; bars of finite length, the other end being free, and the other end being fixed or restrained; impact stresses below yield stress (elastic range), and impact stresses above yield stress (plastic range). The history and gradient of stress and of velocity are represented in three-dimensional diagrams. The energy expended in impact, and its distribution into energy of plastic deformation, and into residual kinetic and elastic stress energy are determined. The total residual permanent strain is determined. The general treatment is supplemented with numerical examples.},
