# ELastic WAve SPAce-TIme Diagrams

ELWA-SPATID is a Python module for the computation of space-time diagrams for
the propagation of elastic waves in 1D rods. The rods can have impedance variations
along thepropagation axis, and it is possible to consider several rods in contact.

Initial conditions can be:

* a prescribed input force at the left end of the first rod;
* a prescribed velocity of the left rod, which impacts the next rod.


This is a simple example package. You can use
